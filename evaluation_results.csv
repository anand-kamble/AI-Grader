Additionally, this technique can experience issues when attempting to maintain large assemblies intact within the dataset.","Hierarchical Clustering is the technique that makes clustering unchangeable once a decision to combine two clusters has been made. The issues arising from different clustering techniques, such as Density Based Clustering, include sensitivity to noise, difficulty in handling clusters of varying sizes and non-globular shapes, and breaking large clusters.",0.8,0.6321568856471081,0.9999999999,1.0,0
